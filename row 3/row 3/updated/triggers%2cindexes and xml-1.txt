1.SQL Server stores only the source for stored procedures and triggers
2.SQL Server keeps the stored procedures & triggers in compiled form for future execution
3.When a stored procedure or trigger is first executed, the source is compiled into an execution plan
4.If the stored procedure or trigger is again executed before the execution plan is aged from memory, the relational engine detects the existing plan and reuses it
5.If the execution plan has aged out of memory, a new plan is built

How does SQL server handle Parallel query processing?
1.During query optimization, SQL Server looks for queries or index operations that might benefit from parallel execution
2.SQL Server inserts exchange operators into the query execution plan to prepare the query for parallel execution
3.After exchange operators are inserted, the result is a parallel-query execution plan which can use more than one thread 
4.After exchange operators are inserted, the queries are compiled into an executable
