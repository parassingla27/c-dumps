How are Null values handled in Joins sql server 2008?
1.When there are null values in the columns of the tables being joined, null value of the right table is matched with the null value of the left table
2.When there are null values in the columns of the tables being joined, the null values do not match each other
3.The presence of null values in a column from one of the tables being joined can be returned only by using an inner join
4.The presence of null values in a column from one of the tables being joined can be returned only by using an outer join
5.When null values are present in data being joined, it is usually preferable to omit them from the results by using a regular join
