What are the advantages of using EXECUTE AS clause?
1.The execution becomes faster
2.You can control which user account the Database Engine uses to validate permissions on any objects that are referenced by the module
3.It provides additional flexibility and control in managing permissions across the object chain that exists between user-defined modules and the objects referenced by those modules
4.Users of the module only need permissions to execute the module itself; explicit permissions on the referenced objects are not required
5.Users of the module need explicit permissions on the referenced objects thereby making it more secure

4.A Global temporary procedure is dropped at the end of the last session using the procedure
5.If a global temporary procedure is created, all users with EXECUTE permissions can access it & permissions can also be revoked explicitly
