1.When there are null values in the columns of the tables being joined, null value of the right table is matched with the null value of the left table
2.When there are null values in the columns of the tables being joined, the null values do not match each other
3.The presence of null values in a column from one of the tables being joined can be returned only by using an inner join
4.The presence of null values in a column from one of the tables being joined can be returned only by using an outer join
5.When null values are present in data being joined, it is usually preferable to omit them from the results by using a regular join

Carefully read the question and answer accordingly.Which statements are true about Computed columns?
1.By default, computed columns are not physically stored in the table
2.Values are retrieved from the internal database cache when they are referenced in a query
3.Values are recalculated every time they are referenced in a query
4.A computed column once created cannot be persisted at a later stage
5.The Database Engine uses the PERSISTED keyword in the CREATE TABLE to physically store computed columns in the table

Carefully read the question and answer accordingly.Which statements are true about CROSS APPLY operator?
