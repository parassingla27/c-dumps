1.To open a connection
2.To set attributes or properties defining the characteristics of the cursor the API automatically maps over each result set
3.To execute one or more Transact-SQL statements
4.To use API functions or methods to fetch the rows in the result sets
5.To handle errors

How will you optimize the performance of the cursor if there are multiple rows & columns to be fetched?
1.Use all columns in the Declare statement
2.Use only the required columns in the Declare statement
3.Change your where clause in the declare statement to only return rows the cursor needs
4.Ensure you have optimal indexes in place

Carefully read the question and answer accordingly.Identify disadvantages of using cursors.
1.They consume more resources
2.Performance gets hampered due to network round-trips if multiple rows have to be fetched
3.Performance gets hampered if only the required rows & columns are fetched
4.Performance gets hampered if all the rows & columns are fetched
5.Resources remain unused on the server if cursors are not closed properly

What does the LOCAL argument in the DECLARE CURSOR statement denote?
1.Specifies that cursor can be available only in the batch, stored procedure, or trigger in which the cursor was created
2.Specifies that cursor can be available to all local resources
3.The LOCAL cursor will be implicitly deallocated when the batch, stored procedure, or trigger terminates
4.The LOCAL cursor will have to be explicitly deallocated when the batch, stored procedure, or trigger terminates

How do FORWARD_ONLY cursors work?
1.Data is fetched in bulk
2.Data is fetched sequentially from the first to the last row
3.FETCH NEXT is the only fetch option supported
4.FETCH PREVIOUS is the only fetch option supported

What all is included in creation of Control flow?
1.Adding containers that implement repeating workflows in a package or divide a control flow into subsets
2.Adding containers that implement conditional statements
3.Adding tasks that support data flow, prepare data, perform workflow and business intelligence functions, and implement script
4.Separating containers and tasks into an ordered control flow by using precedence constraints
5.Connecting containers and tasks into an ordered control flow by using precedence constraints

Integration Services includes three types of containers that you can use in a control flow, which are they?
1.The DoWhile Loop container
2.The Foreach Loop container
3.The For Loop container

What is the significance of precedence constraints?
1.Precedence constraints link executables, containers, and tasks in packages into a control flow
2.A precedence constraint links two executables: the precedence executable and the constrained executable
3.The precedence executable runs before the constrained executable
4.The precedence executable runs after the constrained executable

Which statements are true about the expression used in precedence constraints?
1.The expression must evaluate to an integer
2.The expression must evaluate to true or false
3.The expression can use literals, system & custom variables
4.The expression can use stored procedures
5.The expression can use functions & operators that SSIS grammar provides

What is the significance of Sequence Containers? Please choose all the relevant options
1.They define a repeating control flow in a package
2.They define conditions in a package
3.They define a control flow that is a subset of the package control flow
4.They group the package into multiple separate control flows, each containing one or more tasks and containers that run within the overall package control flow
