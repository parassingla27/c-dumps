When does Unboxing occur?
 







Unboxing occurs when you assign a value type variable to a variable of type object  




Unboxing occurs when you assign a value type variable to another variable of type value  




Unboxing occurs when you assign a variable of type object to a variable with same type as the true type of the object  -----




Unboxing occurs when you assign a reference  type variable to a variable of type object

Which of the following statements is correct about the C#.NET code snippet given below? class Sample
{
    private int i;
    public Single j;
    private void DisplayData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i + " " + j);
    }
    public void ShowData()
    {
        Console.WriteLine(i + " " + j);
    }
}
 







j cannot be declared as public.  




There is no error in this class.  ----




DisplayData() cannot be declared as private.  




DisplayData() cannot access j.
