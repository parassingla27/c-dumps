Which are the different ways in which you can separate code & content in ASP.NET?
1.By using code-behind files that are pre-compiled modules written in any .NET compliant languages
2.By using resource files
3.By creating user controls
4.By moving business logic into components that can run on the server & calling those components from server-side

What is the differemce w.r.t working between Statement-1 & Statement-2?
Statement-1: SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(“Data Source=localhost;Integrated Security=True;Initial Catalog=Pubs”);

Statement-2: SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(“Server=localhost;Integrated Security=True;Initial Catalog=Pubs”);
 







Statemenr-2 will generate an error  




Statement-1 is used for connecting to a local database  




Both statements work in the same manner  ----




Statement-2 is used for connecting to a remote database  




Which all statements are true about Partial Methods?
1.Partial methods must be members of partial types
2.Partial methods must be in the same file
3.There are two parts to partial methods: a defining part and implementation part
4.Partial methods have only the implementation part

What are the advantages of partitioning an ASP.NET web page?
1.Individual members of the development team can work on separate, individually-owned parts
2.Developers can work within environments that are familiar
3.Database administrators can create database related tasks independently
4.Web Authors can use HTML development tools to build the interface

What will happen if there is an implementing partial without a defining partial in a partial method?
 







Compiler generates an error ---- 




Compiler omits the code  




Compiler will generate the defining partial  




Compiler will consider the implementing partial as a normal method and compile the code  



What are the advantages of partial classes?
1.When multiple deployments are required
2.When working on large projects, spreading a class over separate files allows multiple programmers to work on it simultaneously
3.When multiple versions of assembly are required
4.When working with automatically generated source, code can be added to the class without having to recreate the source file

Which are the basic steps for separating a ASP.NET web page?
1.Create a file for user interface
2.Create a file for database
3.Create a file for interface logic

When should the option of precompiling the Web site to have non-updatable UI be used? 
1.When you want to have a read-only UI
2.When your UI code contains intellectual property that you want to protect from people who have access to the production server
3.When you do not have to change the UI often
4.When you want to have only compiled DLLs on the production server

Carefully read the question and answer accordingly.Please go through the following code & select the relevant options:
// File-A
public partial struct CurrencyDetails
{
 private double amount;
 public double Amount
 {
  get
  {
   return amount;
  }
  set
  {
   amount = value;
   AmountChanged(amount);
  }
 }

 partial void AmountChanged(double amount);
}


// File-B
public partial struct CurrencyDetails
{
 partial void AmountChanged(double amount)
 {
  MessageBox.Show(“Amount is “ + amount.ToString());
 }
}
1.It is an example of sealed class
2.It is an example of Partial Method
3.AmountChanged method has only defining partial
4.AmountChanged method has defining partial as well as implementing partial

Carefully read the question and answer accordingly.What are your observations on the following code? 
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;

class Sample
{
    static void Main()
    {
       Trace.Listeners.Add(new TextWriterTraceListener(Console.Out));
       Trace.AutoFlush = true;
       Trace.Indent();
       Trace.WriteLine("Entering Main");
       Console.WriteLine("Sample Program");
       Trace.WriteLine("Exiting Main"); 
       Trace.Unindent();
    }
}

1.The following code snippet enables application level tracing
2.The following code snippet shows usage of Trace class
3.In the following code the start & end of the program is traced
4.The following code writes trace output to a text file
