Which all statements are true about partitioning?
1.Partitioning enables you to manage and access subsets of data from large tables quickly and efficiently
2.The integrity of a data collection is maintained
3.The integrity of a data collection is not automatically maintained but will have to be handled manually
4.Maintenance operations target only the data that is required, instead of the whole table hence are more efficient
5.Maintenance operations target the whole database instead of individual tables hence are more efficient

4.They provide the most direct way to obtain, transform & present customized forms of the catalog metadata
5.Catalog view names as well as the names of their columns are descriptive
